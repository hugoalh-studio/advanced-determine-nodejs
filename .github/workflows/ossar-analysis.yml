      # Ensure a compatible version of dotnet is installed. The [Microsoft Security Code Analysis CLI](https://aka.ms/mscadocs) is built with dotnet v3.1.201. A version greater than or equal to v3.1.201 of dotnet must be installed on the agent in order to run this action. Remote agents already have a compatible version of dotnet installed and this step may be skipped. For local agents, ensure dotnet version 3.1.201 or later is installed by including this action:
